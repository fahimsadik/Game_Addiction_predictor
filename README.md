# Game_Addiction_predictor
This university project uses Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models to predict gaming addiction and its correlation with mental and physical health. The Python-based application, with a Tkinter GUI, lets users answer a questionnaire. It then uses the pre-trained models to provide real-time predictions and visualizations.
